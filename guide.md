For now there are 2 jupyter files: 
- **create_db** creates the database yoga.db and all the tables 
- **app** is the main file which runs the app 

In **templates** folder there are 2 html files, here is why: 
- the **base.html** is the main template which stores the navigation bar code
- **register.html** is the child file of base.html, it takes the navbar from there and has the register form
